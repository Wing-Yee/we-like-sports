Chelsea had 7 players out with COVID plus several injured. EFL asked them to fill in the numbers with youth players or forfeit the match vs Brentford.
 
Same happened vs Wolves in PL.

Liverpool refuse to tell how many are out with COVID and they have their game postponed.

In that time, he's won the Champions League, Premier League, EFL Cup, Club World Cup and Super Cup.

He's been the PL POTY, UEFA POTY and Ballon d'Or runner-up...

Unbeaten run for #Stags stops at 14 league games. All good things come to an end at some point as they say. Promotion still well in Mansfield’s hands.

Big win for #TRFC, up to 3rd ahead of play tomorrow after first victory in 6.

Should that happen, #EFC WILL NOT be handed a points deduction as the EFL have different rules.

As things stand, Everton in talks to avoid any repercussions for falling foul of FFP.

#EFC are facing a potential points deduction from the Premier League for breaking the profit and sustainability rules.

They made losses of more than £260m between 2017 and 2020.

This is £155m more than what is permitted.

Everton will now have crunch talks with the league.

Young players in non league. Unless you’ve been given a clear plan of your progression. You need to pick mins over club status/league level. 

Every minute you’re not playing, someone else is gaining that valuable experience. It’s okay to drop a league OR TWO to move forward

Cuando tenían la Premier League, ellos y Fox solo pasaban el 20% de los partidos.

Ahora con la EFL Cup, de 8 partidos, van a pasar 3. BeIN si pasa los 8

Fuck off

No se enojen porque gana Argentina, mejor vayamos aprendiendole algunas 'cosillas';

*Su Selección NO pertenece a ninguna televisora
*Los derechos televisivos son para TODOS
*De toda la plantilla albiceleste solo uno juega en su liga local (Armani)
*Su DT es de su país

They already have 2 postponements that need to be recheduled.
They could get another 3 postponements due to clashes with the EFL Cup Final and the FA Cup QFs and SFs.

They're only guaranteed 3 free midweeks.
5 doesn't fit into 3.

(the problem goes away if they lose to Barca)

23 big chances created in total from all comps for Bruno and just 6 assists. 1 in the league, 1 in the Efl cup, 1 in the Uel and 3 in the WC. 

Minus the WC and it’s 3 assists from 18 big chances created. We’ve really let him down.
