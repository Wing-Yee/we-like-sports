From coming 3rd in World Cup 3 years ago, to winning 6 FNCS titles and now winning a $1,000,000 LAN with some of the best players in the world. The fact he has managed to maintain that level of skill and consistency for that long. Just insane

Neymar has now scored or assisted in each of his last 16 games for club and country after scoring against Toulouse today. Beating Messi’s and Ronaldo’s best G/A streak of 15 straight matches for both.

He is now tied with Lewandowski for the best G/A streak of the 21st century.

Katie Ledecky just set a world record in the 1500 Freestyle at the FINA World Cup in Toronto. She finished in 15:08.64, shaving nearly 10 seconds off the previous world record.

#FIFAWorldCup GKs should’ve stayed central vs PKs more!

 64% of PKs were hit to the closed side & 61% of GKs dived to the closed side

 22% of PKs were hit to the open side & 33% of GKs dived to the open side
